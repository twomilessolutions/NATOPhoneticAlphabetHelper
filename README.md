# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Helper

## Overview
Python script to allow a user to easily translate a word, phrase or sentence into the NATO Phonetic Alphabet.

This set of scripts does the following:
* **NATOTranslator.py**: this file defines the class to be used to translate a word, phrase, or sentence into the NATO phonetic alphabet.
* **NATOConsole.py**: this file will prompt the user for a word, phrase, or sentence, pass it to the *NATOTranslator* class, then print out the translation.

## Why
I have never been in the armed forces and I've tried for years to memorize the phonetic alphabet (sticky notes on my monitor, etc...) but every time I get into a situation where I need to relay spelling to someone on the phone, I fumble and bumble out something that is NOT the phonetic alphabet. So, being the nerd that I am, I wrote a script for it.
